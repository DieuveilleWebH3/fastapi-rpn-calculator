# 🧮 RPN Calculator API – FastAPI + Docker + PostgreSQL

## 🎯 Objective

This project proposes the creation of a **REST API for a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator**.
The goal is to help our users perform complex calculations while keeping a history of operations in a database.
The application should also allow for **CSV export** of results.

The project is divided and managed according to a **Scrum** methodology with **tickets estimated in Fibonacci story points**.

## 📅 Duration & Organization

- **Single Sprint**: 8 days
- **Start**: Monday, June 16, 2025
- **End**: Wednesday, June 25, 2025

> 🎲 1 Story Point = 1 day of work
>
> Fibonacci sequence used: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...

| T4    | Route POST /calculate                      | 2 SP         | 18/06     | Receives an expression, returns a JSON with the result. Handles errors |
| T5    | Creation of SQLAlchemy ORM Models          | 2 SP         | 18/06     | Model `Operation(id, expression, result)` persisted via PostgreSQL |
| T6    | Addition of Persistence Service             | 3 SP         | 19/06     | Results well stored and retrieved from the database after a calculation |

## 🔧 Quick Start

### 📦 Prerequisites

- Docker / Docker Compose
- Python 3.10+ (for local testing)
- Git

### 📂 Accessing Endpoints

- **Swagger Documentation**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- **API**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### 🧪 Testing Locally

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/calculate" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"expression": "5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -"}'
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "expression": "5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -",
  "result": 14.0
}
```

### 📁 Export CSV

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/export" -H "Accept: text/csv"
```

Expected response: downloadable CSV file with the performed operations.

### 🤝 Contributions

For any contribution, please:

Create a branch with the same name as the ticket `rpn-t<ID>`
Each commit must be linked to a Jira ticket and follow the format `rpn-t<ID> - Commit description`
Make a PR to the `dev` branch

Follow the code style (Black formatting + type hints)

Write unit tests for any business logic

To run the project locally, create a virtual environment and a `.env` file at the root and replace the default values (make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and running):

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

PS:

- Make sure to have the dependencies installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt` before starting the project.

- Containerization with Docker will be done in collaboration with the DevOps Engineer/Tech Lead for skill development.
